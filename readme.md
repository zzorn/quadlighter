===========

Led PWM light controller board.

Contains Eagle scematics and board layout.

Uses I2C bus controllable PCA9685 and two ULN2803 darlington arrays.

Has outputs for four RGB led strips, and four extra 12V PWM outputs (e.g. small powerled, fans, or such).

Use the solder jumpers to configure the I2C address of a device before use (either the 0 or 1 solder pad must be bridged for each address byte).
